C@MATLAB=CATLAB
----
This project is tend to write a series of C interface of various useful MATLAB functions.
Every interfaces are written as similar as posible to MATLAB function.
CATLAB tends to use the same library (such as blas, lapack, arpack, umfpack, etc.), and the same algorithm as MATLAB does.
# Functions already built-in
* mldivide (for sparse matrix)
* eig
* eigs (for complex matrix)
